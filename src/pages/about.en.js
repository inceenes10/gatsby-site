                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            I've been working on software development since 2016,
                            I'm interested in web programming, machine learning, deep learning and database systems.
                            I'm <strong>Enes Ince</strong> from Istanbul Technical University in the Department of Electrical Engineering.
                            Today, I'm going to talk about my past a little bit, then talk about my today and my future
                            goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was born in <strong>Gaziantep/Åžahinbey</strong> before about 19 years ago from today. In the year of 2015,
                            I started to high school and in January of 2016, with the suggestion of my friend with whom I'm in same
                            dormitory, I started to write code with <strong>C programming language</strong>, but I don't know English, math
                            and the needs for <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>software engineering</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over time, I began to complete these needs, but this time I missed the classes and
                            I was behind my peers in terms of classes. When I came to 12. grade, I switched to open education
                            high school and I began to prepare university exam (YKS). With the exam results, I entered
                            Istanbul Technical University Electrical Engineering Department.
                            After entering the university, I studied in one-year preparation school (YDY)
                            and today, I'm a freshman in electrical engineering department.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, I have a intermediate-advanced insight into web development (frontend - backend)
                            and basic understanding of machine learning (python).
                            Among my future goals, I will focus on the intersect of machine learning and
                            electrical engineering. That's why I chose Smart Grids, which it is even its infant,
                            and I think that Smart Grids is technology of upcoming years and
                            I will continue my career in Smart Grids.

                            The goal of opening up this blog is that I'd like to

                            with others. I hope you enjoy reading my contents. This blog is for you
                            to discover my world.
